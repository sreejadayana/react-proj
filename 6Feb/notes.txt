node package manager:any application developed using react is consider as a package and these packages are mainted by npm.

npx:node package execute is a command to execute a node command to create a react project without installing react globally into the machine.
(so any application that you can create using react, it is going to be considered as package )=>node package manager


modules explanation:
package.json:means
  "name": "firstapp",(name of the application)
  "version": "0.1.0",(current version) (it is called appliaction version)(0.1.0 semantic version)(0 means majorversion)(1 means version)(0 means patch release or bug )
  "private": true,(this is not open source project)
  depencieces are nothing but the libraries that your applicaton is dependent on so by default,any application that you work on using react by default this a the depencies that required

"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0", // ( react current version)

    "build": "react-scripts build",
