Front End  - UI
Web Services: A Service that can be accessed through / over internet.
Backend - Logic - API URL 

(ajax) and async both are same

. sync ->  make call, wait and then use that response (line by line)

2. async -> make call, does not wait ,continue the execution for the rest of the 
lines of code and call back functions will take the response later point of time. 

-->

to learn little bit AJAX so we will try to understand how we can use uh http protocol on the frantend to make on API call and acces this data
(asynchrouns javascriptxml) with out http we are not able to understand to provide communication between two websites two appliaction over to the internet
***AJAX stands for asynchronous javascriptxml.
which is use to send the httprequest in background that means, when we click on particular button then
AJAX IS CAPABLE TO SEND THE HTTPREQUEST WITHOUT RELOADING THE WEPAGE forexample:facebook,youtube,instagram etc.,
